There once was a dev with a scheme,
To deploy AWS resources with a team,
They chose Terraform to script,
And the process was whipped,
Now their infrastructure is a dream!

But then the bucket a hole did get
and this caused a mighty threat
quick as a hare 
they got it out of there
and the coding objectives were met
